# Excel Birding Dashboard

For this final project, we’ll choose a real-world scenario so that we can create a dashboard according to your scenario’s purpose and goal. We’ll work in small groups. The rubric for the dashboard (minimum requirements) is presented below, but feel free to make your dashboard amazing by putting more time into it. After you create your dashboard, your group will present to the class. Then, during the next class we’ll have a peer-review critique.
Goal

This final project will integrate elements from the entire  Visual Communications course. After we create a dashboard, you’ll present it to the class. Your dashboard could also become a good portfolio piece to show potential future employers.
Your Role

Using Miro, you’ll build your dashboard with tools available on the website. You’ll work together as a group, whether that means dividing up the tasks among yourselves so that people are working on the areas they are strongest in (for example, someone works on building charts, while another learner works on visuals and labels) or everyone contributes to all aspects of the project.
Evaluation: Rubric

Dashboard:

    Use at least five different metrics/comparisons represented in charts or other ways
    Emphasize more important metrics using color, intensity, or size
    Create an alert of sorts when a metric gets too low or high
    Create titles for the dashboard and axes on charts
    Create labels for your most important metrics or where necessary to promote clarity
    Use at least one image representing the theme of your dashboard

Submission Instructions

Take a screenshot of your dashboard and flow chart and submit it to Canvas.
Scenario 4: Birding Locations Dashboard

This is a public-facing dashboard that will be used as a map to find bird sightings in Vermont. It will also display bird information so tourists can learn about birds.

User/audience: tourists/birders visiting a state park’s website

Purpose: this dashboard is more of an informative one. It doesn’t track birds exactly through GPS, but rather gives general sighting locations as determined by field naturalists. So, this does not need to be in real time. It has more of an advertising component to it. If more people take interest in this dashboard for bird information, they might view the state park more favorably and either donate or visit more often. So, make sure this dashboard inspires people’s love for birds and is attractive and fun.

Alert: this dashboard has no need to alert anyone unless a designated birding area is closed.

Choose five (or more) items for your dashboard:

    Title
    Bird photos
    Ten species of birds found in Vermont (change these if you want!):

Peregrine falcon
	

Yellow-bellied sapsucker

Golden-winged warbler
	

Bobolink

Eastern towhee
	

Chimney swift

Scarlet tanager
	

Red-breasted nuthatch

Wood thrush
	

Blue-winged warbler

    A Vermont state map should be the main graphic in your dashboard. An outline is OK; we don’t want too much detail.
    Mark the bird locations (using scatterplot-like dots or shaded regions) on the map.
    A dropdown menu with all the bird names on it. When you use the dropdown, the entire map changes to show locations of that bird.
    A sound icon so users can click it and hear how the bird sounds
    A season chart (possible line chart?) to show which birds are common during which seasons. Include some migrating birds in spring and fall.
    Common foods chart showing what each bird likes to eat
    A way to search birds by region (define these yourself; for instance, you could have a northern, southern, eastern, western region, or a greater Burlington area region; it’s up to you)
