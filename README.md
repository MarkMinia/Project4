Submission Instructions

This is a public-facing dashboard that will be used as a map to find bird sightings in Vermont. It will also display bird information so tourists can learn about birds.

User/audience: tourists/birders visiting a state park’s website

Purpose: this dashboard is more of an informative one. It doesn’t track birds exactly through GPS, but rather gives general sighting locations as determined by field naturalists. So, this does not need to be in real time. It has more of an advertising component to it. If more people take interest in this dashboard for bird information, they might view the state park more favorably and either donate or visit more often. So, make sure this dashboard inspires people’s love for birds and is attractive and fun.

Alert: this dashboard has no need to alert anyone unless a designated birding area is closed.

Choose five (or more) items for your dashboard:
Title
Bird photos
Ten species of birds found in Vermont (change these if you want!):
Peregrine falcon
Yellow-bellied sapsucker
Golden-winged warbler	
Bobolink
Eastern towhee	
Chimney swift
Scarlet tanager	
Red-breasted nuthatch
Wood thrush	
Blue-winged warbler

A Vermont state map should be the main graphic in your dashboard. An outline is OK; we don’t want too much detail.
Mark the bird locations (using scatterplot-like dots or shaded regions) on the map.
A dropdown menu with all the bird names on it. When you use the dropdown, the entire map changes to show locations of that bird.
A sound icon so users can click it and hear how the bird sounds
A season chart (possible line chart?) to show which birds are common during which seasons. Include some migrating birds in spring and fall.
Common foods chart showing what each bird likes to eat
A way to search birds by region (define these yourself; for instance, you could have a northern, southern, eastern, western region, or a greater Burlington area region; it’s up to you)
